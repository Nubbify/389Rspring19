### Part 2 (75 pts)

The core ethical dilemma here, for me, is whether other's lives are more valuable than business success. I believe that the answer is yes, although how we go about saving those lives can change based on how those above me respond. 

Obviously, the first person I'm going to tell is my boss, their boss, and so on. I want to exhaust my resources inside the company before going outside the company because this information could easily destroy the company if revealed publicly in an improper manner. One could argue that the public should know these things, but if the issue is resolved before any cars get into the customer's hands, then it's better for them to not know at all in order to avoid damaging the reputation of the company. 

Now, if the company is unwilling to fix these issues before bringing the car to market, I believe that is when we should start putting pressure on management by providing information to outside sources. Of course, at this point it's likely that I would lose my job but a place that would sacrifice human lives in order to make a profit is not one that I would want to work for much longer. If I could stop a life from being lost using my knowledge, then not saying anything means that I did nothing to prevent that death. Had I said something or pressured more, then the person who may be a victim of this security exploit could still be alive. 

It's because of both that personal responsibility and difference in values between myself and the company I'm working for that I would go on to release information to a consumer watchdog or government agency if I couldn't get management at the company to prioritize fixing the current security problems.
