## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

The flag was CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}. The input I used was first "nc 1337bank.money 1337" followed by "; cd home; cat flag.txt". My thought process went roughly like this. First I asked myself how the service worked normally. From there I realized it just returned a dig command, which led me to believe it was just piping the terminal output into the socket. I wondered if this was true and so I ran a different command this time. I tried using a semi-colon to see if I was essentially typing into a terminal. The echo command I inserted worked and so I just slowly worked my way through "cd; ls". I started with home since that seemed like a safe bet and I saw flag.txt so then I just went ahead and did ";cd home; cat flag.txt" and grabbed the flag. 
Suggested precautions probably just include whitelisting valid characters so that only those that are in domain names can be used. Anything else should be removed from the input. I'm guessing this command just runs "dig <input>" so I think sanitizing inputs should be enough. 


### Part 2 (60 pts)

[Decided the time and effort necessary did not justify the points on my final grade/gpa]
